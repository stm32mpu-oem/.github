# STM32MPU preliminary release (OEM) software from STMicroelectronics

Our technology starts with You in mind.<br/>
At ST, we are creators of technology. We provide easy-to-use software development tools, design kits, and support educational initiatives to make our technologies accessible to more engineers and enthusiasts today.

The open-source software here is delivered by [ST](https://www.st.com). This software is part of our complete software offer that you can find on  www.st.com together with all the associated documentation and related ST products (devices, reference designs, development boards, and more).

Although the majority of our software is published here under open-source licenses, part of it is released under proprietary licenses. Please check the License.md file included in each repository for more details.

The software distributed in this stm32mpu-oem GitHub organization is a preliminary OEM release. Therefore, no contribution is allowed in this organization.
The official release will be available soon from STMicroelectronics official organization [GitHub](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics). You will be able to provide your contribution there.
